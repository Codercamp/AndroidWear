## CoderCamp 22 - Android Wear Prototype ##

A demo Android Wear application for CoderCamp Hamilton.

This app prototypes an Pub application that lists the 
pubs closest to you, allows you to view their menus and order. 

To demonstrate extending notifications for Android Wear, I 
simulate a notification when you arrive at a pub that asks if you want to order a beer. It allows you to order, or view the full menu on your phone.

In a real system, your order would then be transmitted to the pub, possibly paid for through Google Wallet and your order would be waiting for you.

In an ideal system, the waitress could even have a Google Glass application that shows your image and a directional arrow to you when she picks up your order.
